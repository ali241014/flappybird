# flappybird
 

# anthony's part: first we start with making the ground move by making a loopground script in unity, we add a serializefield , that means that its a value that we could later change and modify to our liking, , in this case , the speed and width . we then adjust the size from the sprite renderer in the start void , then we update the size until it has reached its max width, then we reset it so it can be able to loop smoothly thats why we test it and we settle on 1.3 speed and 6 width units. 
# next we set up a scoring system by importing the flappy bird font : https://www.dafont.com/04b-19.font and by using textmeshpro.Then we position the "Score" and "Best" along with their values on the top of the screen. Then we make a Score c# script , using a serializeField called "_currentScoreText and _highScoreText . Then we use PlayerPrefs function  To score our highscore , then converting it to a string , we make an updateHighScore funcion to update the highscore if the score is higher  and we convert it to a string. and we add an updateScore function where we increase the score everytime we pass through a boxcollider 2d which tracks if the bird has gone between the pipes. And using a new PipeIncreaseScore script, it helps us update our score everytime the bird passes through.
